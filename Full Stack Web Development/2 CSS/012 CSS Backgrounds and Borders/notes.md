# CSS Backgrounds and Borders

**`background-repeat`** - This determines if the image is too small for the page if it should repeat to fill the whitespace

**`border`** - Adds a border to something
  - size - How think the border is
  - type - How you want the line to look
  - color - What color do you want it

```css
border: 5px solid black;
```
