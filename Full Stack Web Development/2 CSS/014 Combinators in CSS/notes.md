# Combinators in CSS

**`Parent Child {...}`** - Every child element at any level under the parent level will have the style applied to it

```css
ul li {
    color: red;
}
```

**`Parent > Child {...}`** - Every child element directly under the parent element will have the style applied to it

```css
ul > li {
    color: black;
}
```
