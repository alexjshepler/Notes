    "Flattening - Taking a 2D image and converting it to a 1D vector\n",
    "\n",
    "The dense layer is 128 units, and will be fully connected to the previous. It also has a ReLU activation because this is more complex than just simple conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will have 10 units, and the value for each will corelate the confidence of each item. The higher the confidence value of a specific unit means that the network thinks that it is that item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of all of the outputs will be 1. To do this, the output layer activation will be softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the network does classification it will have the same number of output units as it does classes, and always use the softmax function\n",

    "If the output is less than or equal to zero, the output will be zero. Otherwise the output will be equal to the input.\n",
