    "\n",
    "The dense layer is 128 units, and will be fully connected to the previous. It also has a ReLU activation because this is more complex than just simple conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will have 10 units, and the value for each will corelate the confidence of each item. The higher the confidence value of a specific unit means that the network thinks that it is that item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of all of the outputs will be 1. To do this, the output layer activation will be softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the network does classification it will have the same number of output units as it does classes, and always use the softmax function\n",

    "\n",
    "We split the data because after the network uses the training data set, we want to test it with data that it hasn't seen before so we know how well it performs. If the practice was the same as the test, we wouldn't be able to tell if the network was just memorizing the answers or if it was actually learning to identify things correctly.\n",
