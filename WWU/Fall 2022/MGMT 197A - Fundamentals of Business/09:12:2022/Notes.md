## Guest Speaker

Finance classes are very practical

With Finance you can either go in the academic rout, or public. For public you could go either banking or corporate. For academic you could be a professor.

For the public rout, it isn't required to have a Phd, but there is a small niche that would benefit from having one. A Phd mainly gives you the research background.

There are no strong differences between a BA and a BS besides what employers are looking for in the classes you've taken

In a research field, you can start a project that might have a 50% chance of failing, compared to corporate where you won't have that freedom.

Accepting rejection is important. You might work on a paper or work on something for 2 years and it might get rejected. You will also be working on 2-3 papers at a time

How will tech impact finance?  
Everything gets looked at in research is studied from an academic standpoint and gets compared against other studies of the same subject
