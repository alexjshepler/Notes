Key Quotes - "Practical skills are built on an understanding of concepts, principles, and theories that explain the human communication process as it takes place in a variety of contexts for many purposes" (West & Turner, 2004)

Main points:

- Communication defined,
- Communication models
- Communication explained
- Communication basics

The Communication Process:

- Systematic processes that people use to interact with symbols to interpret meaning
- Collaborative construction and negotiation between self and others
- Dynamic process where people try to share their ideas and thoughts with others using symbols in certain settings

**System** - Various parts that all work together and impact each other  
**Process** - Interactions that are either ongoing or dynamic  
**Symbols** - They don't have meaning but are used to communicate  
**Meaning** - What we get out of symbols  
**Context** - Refers to people, place, and time (People, you talk to your friends different than your boss or teachers. Place, the professor can talk and lecture in the class room but not your room. Time, each time you hear the same message you get a different meaning out of it, the same way when you watch the same movie over and over again)

**Communication** - Simultaneous sending and receiving of verbal and non verbal messages that are traveling over some form of medium. This gets affected by noise, or interference, and embedded in the context and culture of the participants.

We communicate to create shared meaning

Communication as an **Action** - ***OLDEST***  

- If something is said it is assumed that it is understood

Communication as an **Interaction** - ***OLD***

- At either time a person is sending a message or receiving a message

Communication as a **Transaction**

- At any time a person is sending a message and receiving one at the same time
- People that understand this are the most effective
- Senders and receivers
- Encoding and decoding
- Verbal messages
- Physical noise
- Psychological noise
- Physiological noise
- Culture
- Context
- Shared meaning

Culture and Context affect all communication. This includes norms, beliefs, values and these can change based on the context.

When you send a message to someone it gets encoded then they receive it and they have to decode it

Just because you say something doesn't mean the meaning is understood
