## Culture

Defined in many ways

**Culture**
  - The Beliefs, understandings, practice, and ways of interpreting experience that are shared by a group of people (Wood, 2008)
  - Learned patterns of behavior and attitudes shared by a group of people (Martin & Nakayama, 2005)
  - Learned set of shared interpretations about beliefs, values, norms, and social practices, which affect the behaviors of a relatively large group of people (Lusti & Koester, 2006)
  - Etc.

Culture is not *learned* - You are not born with culture
Culture is a set of *shared interpretations* - People think similarly, subjective
Culture involves *beliefs, values, norms, and social practices* - This is a primary way in which we can differ
Culture affects *behavior* - We "perform" our culture. When we act out, we can make predictions and form expectations about others and their behaviors
Culture involves *large groups* of people - Not individuals or smaller groups

Culture involves *beliefs, values, norms, and social practices*
  - **Beliefs** - An idea about the world people assume to be true/false
    - The world is flat
    - Sun will rise
  - **Values** - Involves what a culture regards as good/bad, right/wrong, beautiful/ugly
    - Respect for elders
    - Personal success
  - **Norms** - The socially shared expectations of appropriate behaviors (unstated rules)

  - **Social Practices** - The predictable behavioral patterns that members of a culture typically follow. Outward manifestations of beliefs, values, and norms

## Intercultural Communication

Defined in many ways

**Intercultural Communication**
  - Occurs between individuals and entities that are culturally unalike (Oetzel, 2009)
  - Involves interaction between people whose cultural perceptions and symbols differ enough to influence the communication event (Samovar, Porter, McDaniel, and Roy, 2013)
  - Occurs when large and important cultural differences create dissimilar interpretations and expectations about how to communicate competently (Lustig and Koester, 2006)

## Ethnocentrism / Similarities
