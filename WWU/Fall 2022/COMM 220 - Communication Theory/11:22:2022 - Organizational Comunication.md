## Organization

**Organization** - A human group that has been deliberately designed so as to achieve a desire objective/goal. Usually it has a large number of participants, at least compared to the small group we discusses recently

**Organizational Communication** - Often defined as the transmission of messages, through both formal and informal channels, of relatively large, deliberately designed group, resulting in the construction of meanings that influence its members, both as individuals and as group

## Institutions

There are many different organizations that exist to meet our needs

**Educational Institutions** - Introduce young people to and teach them about the ways of requirements of society  
**Government Institutions** - Render order, predictability, and security in society  
**Religious Institutions** - Help people understand and try to influence the supernatural  
**Economic Institutions** - Handle the production and distribution of goods and services for a society  
**The Family Institution** - The oldest and most fundamental institution, handles the bearing and rearing of children

## Key Features of Organizational Communication
1. It occurs in Communication networks
2. Links to External Environment
3. Structure

**Communication Networks** - The formal and informal linkages that bring together organizational members when they communicate  
**Links to External Environments** - Organizations are affected by the context in which they reside: people, place, time, etc.  
**Structure** - Provides predictability for members so they understand roles, procedures, and expectations. Most organizations rely on a hierarchical structure

## Organizational Culture

**Organizational culture** - The way of thinking, acting, and understanding work that are shared by members of an organization and that reflect an organization's distinct identity

Communication between members of organizations creates, sustains, and can alter the culture. At the same time, the culture influences patterns of communication between members

There are four kinds of communication that are important to developing, upholding and conveying organizational culture: vocabularies, stories, rites & rituals, and structure

## Vocabularies

Cashier/Clerk, Customer Services Representative, Cast Member

**Masculine Language** - Use terms related to men's interest and experiences

Home Run, Game Plan, Balls, Back Burner, Stir the Pot, Birth to a Plan

## Stories

According to scholars of organizational culture, humans are storytellers by nature

**Corporate** - Convey organizational values, legends, style and history  
**Personal** - Let others know how you see yourself/want to be seen  
**Collegial** - Offer accounts of other members (informal)

## Rites & Ritual

**Rites** - Dramatic, planned set of activities that bring together aspects of cultural ideology in a single event is the definition of a Rite

Promotion, Tenure, Holiday Parties, Annual Picnics, Graduations Awards, Demotions, Reprimands, Firings

**Rituals** - A regularly occurring form of communication that members perceive as familiar and routine parts of organizational life

## Structures

**Structures** - Help organize relationships and interaction between members of an organization
