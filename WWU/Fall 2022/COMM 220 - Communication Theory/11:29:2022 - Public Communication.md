1. Preparation
2. Organization
3. Delivery
4. Analysis

## Preparation

- Anxiety
- Audience
- Know the General Purpose
- Topic Selection
- Specific Purpose/Thesis
- Evidence/Supporting Material

### Anxiety

**Communication Apprehension (CA)** - fear or anxiety associated with real/anticipated *communication encounters* (CE)

Trait (nervous in just about all CE) vs. State (anxious in specific CE)

- Managing CA
- Positive Visualization
- Cognitive Restructuring
- Systematic Desensitization

#### Managing CA

- Positive Visualization (See self reforming confidently)
- Cognitive Restructuring (change/revise the thinking about and approach to speaking, it's an opportunity)
- Systematic Desensitization (process of gradual exposure)

### Audience

- Demographic (age, culture, gender, etc.)
- Psychographic (thoughts - topic, speaker)
- Environmental (time, size, place, tools)

### Know the General Purpose

To inform (report)
To Persuade (advocate)
To Entertain (enjoy)

### Topic Selection

What a speaker exactly wants to accomplish with the audience in his/her specific purpose

### Specific Purpose/Thesis

### Evidence/Supporting Material

## Organization

Intro / Body / Conclusion

Organizational Patterns  
- Temporal/chronological (time sequence)
- Spatial (geographic/physical space, proximity)
- Problem-solution (um, problem - then solution)
- Topical - could be any subtopic (wildcard)

Connectives:  
- Transitions
  - Phrases that connect main ideas
- Sign-posts
  - Signal an important aspect of the speech

Intro - Grab them with a hook before you introduce yourself then keep them  
Body - Supporting material/evidence
Conclusion - Wrap it up, recap what happened, what can they do now, etc.

## Delivery

Earn Credibility (Believability)

Initial (Before you're seen)
Derived
Terminal (When you're gone)

A speaker's credibility resides in the audience, **Not** the speaker!

**Extemporaneous Delivery** - A flexible delivery style that combines the positive aspects of manuscript, memorized, and impromptu speaking

## Analysis

Involves examining self and others to improve
Involves listening (as an audience member)
