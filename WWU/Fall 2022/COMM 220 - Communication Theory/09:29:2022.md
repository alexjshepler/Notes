**Theory** - An idea that hasn't been disproven
**Research** - Experimenting and trying to figure out the answer to a question

Communication is:

- Transactional
- A process
- Symbolic (verbal and nonverbal)
- Unavoidable
- Irreversible
- Unrepeatable
- Has both a content and relational component
- Can be intentional and unintentional (can't not)
- Not more is always better
- Not a panacea (cure-all)
- Effective is not a natural ability

Context: People, place, time

## Defining Theory

While it is hard to find a universally accepted definition for theory, the following definitions may be helpful

- An abstract system of concepts and their relationships that help us to understand a phenomenon (West and Turner, 2006)  
- Provides ann abstract understanding of the communication process (Daiton and Zelly, 2015)  
- A set of systematic, informed hunches about the way things work (Griffen, Ledbetter, and Sparks, 2015)  
- ..Careful systematic, and self-conscious discussion and analysis of communication phenomenon (Boremann in Griffin et al, 2015)

Scholarly theories are often classified based on their level of generalization (West and Turner, 2006)  
**Grand theories** - purport to explain all of communication in a manner that is universally true
> Everyone talks about the weather  
**Mid-range theories** - Explain the behavior of a specific group of people or try to explain the behavior of all people within a specified time or context
> When talking to a stranger we talk about the weather  
**Narrow theories** - Attempt to explain a very limited aspect of a phenomenon such as communication in specific situations
> When getting our haircut we talk about the weather

## Components of Theory

Theories are composed of several key parts, the two most important of which are **Concepts** and **Relationships** (West and Turner, 2006)

**Concepts** - The words or terms for the most important elements in a theory

- Nominal concepts (not observable) Democracy or Love
- Real concepts (observable) Touch or Spatial Distance

**Relationships** - They specify ways in which the concepts in a theory are combined

### Long-Distance Relationships

Relational Satisfaction (nominal concept and a dependent variable)

Distance (real concept and independent variable)

Relational Satisfaction will DECREASE as the distance between people INCREASES

## Goals of Theory

**Explanation** - Some theories seek to offer reasons for or a cause of particular phenomenon  
**Understanding** - Some theories help us grasp or comprehend the meaning intended (or expressed) of a particular phenomenon  
**Prediction** - Some theories seek to predict future outcomes  
**Social Change** - Some theories seek to facilitate social change through criticism of current systems

## The Dark Side of Communication

Popular culture has made communication appear to be a panacea for all of life's aliments

Communication does have a negative component

Negative communication can be manipulative, sarcastic, abusive, and humiliating

Some scholars feel that there has not been enough attention given to negative components of communication

It is important to consider this **dark side** when reading communication theories

## Scientific Method (Deductive Theory)

Defining the problem;  
Reviewing the literature;  
Formulating a hypothesis:
Definition; Independent and dependent variables;
Selecting a research method:
    Population and samples;
    Experiment;
    Observational study;
    Survey and questionnaires;
    Interviews;
    Participant observation;
    Collecting data;
Analyzing results:
    Mean, median, and mode;
    Correlation / correlation co-efficient;
    p value; Reliability and validity;
Drawing conclusions
