### The Listening Process

**Listening** - The acquisition, processing, and retention of information in the interpersonal context

1. Hearing/Selecting
   - Selecting the noise that you are wanting to hear
2. Attending
   - This is where the individual is turning their attention to the thing they heard
3. Understanding
   - You have to understand the words that are spoken to you in order to be an effective listener
4. Responding
   - Giving the person who's talking an indication that you are listening/understanding what they are saying in a positive way
5. Remembering
   - This is the hardest stage for individuals in the listening process

  - External noise
    - People talking, coughing, playing music, sneezing, etc.

    - Thinking about other stuff while the other peron is talking
  - Rapid thought
    - Processing their info faster than the person is speaking
  - Prejudge
    - You think you know what they are going to say, so you prejudge and sometimes end up not actually getting what he/she meant

### Types of Ineffective Listening

1. Pseudo Listening
   - Pseudo listening is an imitation of the real thing. An act put on to fool the speaker
   - Pseudo listeners give the appearance of being attentive, when in reality they aren't listening at all
2. Stage-hogging
   - Stage-hogs try to turn the topic of conversation to themselves instead of showing interest in the speaker
3. Selective listening
   - Selective listeners respond only to the parts of your remarks that interests them, rejecting everything else
4. Insulated listeners
   - Insulated listeners are almost the opposite of their "selective" cousins. Instead of looking for specific information, these people avoid it. Whenever a topic arises that they would rather not deal with, those who use insulated listening simply fail to hear or acknowledge it.
5. Defensive listening
   - Defensive listeners take other's remarks as personal attacks
6. Ambushing
   - Ambushers listen carefully to you, but only because they are collecting information that they'l use to attack what you say. Something you say one day can be brought up in a fight, conversation, etc. another day
7. Insensitive listening
   - Those who use insensitive listening respond to the superficial content in a message, but miss the more important emotional information that may not be expressed directly

### Informational Listening

- Talk less
- Get rid of distractions
- Don't judge prematurely
- Look for key ideas
- Ask sincere questions
  - Try to be more active
  - Try to learn more
- Use aids
  - Write stuff down, record information
- Paraphrase
  - Restating what the the person said or meant in your own way

### Relational Listening

- Advising
  - Offering a solution
- Analyzing
  - Interpreting the situation
- Judging
  - Evaluating his/her mindset;judging the person
- Questioning
  - Clarifying the context
- Supporting
  - Sympathy, solidarity

Context and gender play a big part in these types of responses
