## Warm Up

Suppose P = 4t+10, which is the number of people in the dining hall t minutes after it opens for breakfast. Interpret slope and y intercept in context.

Slope - 4, Every minute after the dining hall opens there are 4 more people that enter
Y Intercept - 10, When the dining hall opens for breakfast there are 10 people that are inside.

## Examples One

Data take form the Hanford Nuclear Base shows cancer deaths per 100,000 in surrounding counties given their distance from the site

| County        | Index | Deaths |
| ------        | ----- | ------ |
| Umatilla      | 2.5   | 147    |
| Morrow        | 2.6   | 130    |
| Gilliam       | 3.4   | 130    |
| Sherman       | 1.3   | 114    |
| Wasco         | 1.6   | 138    |
| Hood River    | 3.8   | 162    |
| Portland      | 11.6  | 208    |
| Columbia      | 6.4   | 178    |
| Clashia       | 8.3   | 210    |

a) What should our independent variable be? Why?
    - The index, or distance, should be the independent variable because we have control over it and this can exist without the amount of deaths
b) What should our dependant variable be? Why?
    - The deaths, because we get the amount of deaths based on the distance, and it can't exist without the deaths

### Error
__Error__ - Actual value of dependant variable (y) minus the predicted value fo the dependant variable
