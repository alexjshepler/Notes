## __Warm Up__

What is the equation of a line through (3, 5) with slope of -1/4

Y - Y<sub>1</sub> = M(X - X<sub>1</sub>)
Y - 5 = (-1/4)(X - 3)
Y - 5 = (-X/4) - (-3/4)
Y = (-X/4) + (23/4)

## __Exercise__

Day 0 - April 20th

| Number of Songs   | Paring Days   |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| 41                | 20            |
| 38                | 24            |

__Independent Variable__ - Number of Songs
__Dependant__ - Paring Days

Y-Intercept: 53.06 - If the bird knew zero songs, we could expect it to take about 53.06 days to pair
X-Intercept: 62.591 - If the bird knew about 62.591 songs, we could expect it to pair on the first day

__Error__ - Actual - Prediction (Y or Dependant variable)

Residual = Error

Good residual characteristics:

- About equal positive and negative
- Small residuals (in context)
- Scattered and shows no pattern

__Max Error__ - The largest absolute error

__Error Bounds__ - The reasonable range for data to fall into

__Upper Error Bound__ - Y<sub>U</sub> = Y + Max Error
__Lower Error Bound__ - Y<sub>L</sub> = Y - Max Error
